# CS370

For this project, I was provided with a starter environment and some initial framework code to run the pirate agent within a maze-like setting. The given code included the structure for the game world and some basic class definitions. I developed the core reinforcement learning logic myself, including implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm. I created the neural network to approximate Q-values, built the experience replay buffer to improve training stability, and tuned the exploration-exploitation balance. The Jupyter Notebook documents these steps, showing the code I wrote to train the agent to successfully navigate the maze and find the treasure.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design, build, and optimize systems that solve problems. They use algorithms, data structures, and computational thinking to turn complex tasks into repeatable, efficient processes. This matters because almost every industry. from healthcare to entertainment—relies on these systems to function and improve. This project showed me how algorithms can learn behaviors autonomously, which has huge implications for automation and AI-driven decision-making.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller parts and analyzing their requirements. For this project, I defined the states, actions, and rewards, then mapped out how an agent could learn through trial and error. I planned the algorithm, tested it, and adjusted based on results. This systematic approach helps make complex challenges manageable.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to create solutions that are fair, safe, and reliable. For AI projects like this, it’s important to consider bias, data privacy, and the potential impacts of automation. The end user should be able to trust that the system behaves as intended, and the organization should be confident that it aligns with legal and ethical standards. For example, reinforcement learning agents could be used in critical areas; making sure they act predictably and transparently is part of my duty.
